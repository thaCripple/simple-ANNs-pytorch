My study of the torchvision library.

I managed to figure out and implement various visualization techniques.

I used torchmetrics and sklearn methods to evaluate the model.


Next time I want to improve my ability to work with torch.Tensors; namely how to *append* values to an empty tensor like I would with a python list
